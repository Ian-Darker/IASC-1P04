## IASC 1P04

Lost in the Wind is a short exploration story game where the player goes on a journey to find themself. As they make choices through the game the player impacts not only their story but the story of the non player characters aswell. Explore the city, meet The Rock, and buy corndogs, and find your creator, there is so much to do. Did I mention that you play as a fart! Lost in the Wind conveys the idea that you choose who you are, you are not defined by your upbringings you are defined by your actions. Enjoy the lighthearted, and goofy adventure game Lost in the Wind.
